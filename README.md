This simple program is designed to take in any list import (paragraph, essay, paper or list of information) and make it a python-array. Simply-put, whenever the program sees a space, it cuts up the variable containing the import into an array of two values: the cut up value and the rest of the imported data. The cut up value is appending to a list as an element, and so on it appends each word or sentences to a single array format.
